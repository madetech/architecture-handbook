# Strategic Guides
## Overview
This directory serves as the North Star for our architectural evolution. While Principles define our rules and Playbooks define our actions, Strategic Guides provide the long-term vision and "why" behind major shifts in our technology landscape.

These documents are intended to bridge the gap between high-level business goals and technical execution.

## Current Strategic Focuses
