# Responsive Architecture Approaches

Taking a step further back and thinking more abstractly about designing software and services we encounter design patterns which attempt to make larger scale designs more responsive to change.

You don't need to know these in depth but being aware of their existence and what they are trying to achieve will help you in your design process.

The patterns below are some good starting points but you will find many more if you dig deeper.

##  DCI (Data, context, and interaction)  Architecture

A slightly different twist on the above approaches where users and their behaviour are moved to the fore.
> Objects are principally about people and their mental modelsâ€”not polymorphism, coupling and cohesion
>  ... but in spite of capturing structure, OO fails to capture behavior


-   To improve the readability of  [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming "Object-oriented programming")  code by giving system behavior first-class status;
-   To cleanly separate code for rapidly changing system behavior (what a system  _does_) versus slowly changing  [domain knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge "Domain knowledge")  (what a system  _is_), instead of combining both in one class interface;
-   To help software developers reason about system-level state and behavior instead of only object state and behavior;
-   To support an object style of thinking that is close to programmers' mental models, rather than the class style of thinking that overshadowed object thinking early in the history of object-oriented programming languages.

## Clean Architecture

Clean architecture is an amalgamation of a number of architecture strategies. It is an attempt to create a separation of concerns. This separation is achieved by dividing the software into layers such as decoupling UI from the Business logic or external dependancies to increase testability and changeability of components increasing your softwares responsiveness to change.
  
The overriding rule that makes this architecture work is _The Dependency Rule_. This rule says that _source code dependencies_ can only point _inwards_.

A simple [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys_W6MyWOCw) that nicely explains when and when not to follow dogma based on trade offs. (15 minutes)
