You are probably confused as to what an architect does and thats not surprising ! The role of the architect has evolved in many different directions and organisations deliver architecture in many different ways.

However, fundamentally they are all working to achieve the same goals.

 - Ensure technical designs meet the user and business needs, delivering clear outcomes
 - Ensure technical delivery is of high quality and value for money

This is often achieved by:

 - Working closely with the business or service area to understand goals
 - Working closely with developers, advising, mentoring and developing skills 
 - Setting technical design standards and guidelines for ways of working
 - Sharing knowledge through communities of practice
 - Communicating clearly at different levels and audiences
 - Looking left and right across the technical landscape minimising divergence and increasing convergence
 - Governance
