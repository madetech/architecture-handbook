# Getting Started

### Video Links

We recommend watching this video on the modern architecture approach which tackles, the role of IT, change and thinking like an architect.

### Unicorn Project

We also recommend reading this novel about a large IT project in an organisation in need of digital transformation. 

The book follows the story of a technical lead (acting like a modern architect) being thrown into a failing project and trying to unpick and correct the technical and business failures.

It's an easy and fun read but gives a practical insight into the role.
