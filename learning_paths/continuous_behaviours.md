## Keeping documentation close to code

## Identifying 'non' requirements

Quality Attributes or Non Functional Requirements need to be considered and balanced as they are normally a trade off, examples could be:

 - Performance
 - Interoperability
 - Deployability
 - Reliability
 - Availability
 - Security
 - Maintainability
 - Observability
 - Testability
 - Scaleability
 - Modifiability
 - Reusability
 - Audibility

##  Managing risk

[Risk Storming](https://riskstorming.com/)

-   A visual and collaborative risk identification technique
-   Can be applied to architectures, business processes, workflows, etc
-   Can be applied multiple times during the lifetime of the thing being risk stormed
