# The Role of the Architect

Traditionally the architect role has evolved into certain activities at different levels within an organisation.

You will see some architects working closely with the exec team and never with developers, others work close to the coal face and organisations like to keep this distinction by differing titles. 

## Typical Public Sector Roles

The Public Sector is made up of hundreds (if not thousands) of organiations all moving at a differing pace and many levels of size and digital maturity.

GDS have a definition of architecture roles here:

However, alignment with DDaT professions is not a given and on the ground you are likely to see.

### Enterprise Architect

### Technical Architect

Can also be described as: **Application Architect** or **Software Architect** or **Product Architect** 

### Cloud Architect

Can also be described as: **Infrastructure Architect** 

### Other roles you might see

Integration architect, Solution Architect, Security Architect, Data Architect, Transformation Architect 

## The Modern Architect

We are seeing the emergence of a modern architect within leaner, more agile 'Digital Enterprises' where role and activities are less siloed.

> Modern architects align organization and technology, reduce friction, and chart transformation journeys. In addition to working with UML and architecture styles, such architects ride the Architect Elevator from the penthouse, where the business strategy is set, to the engine room, where the enabling technologies are implemented. They shun popular buzzwords in favor of a clear strategy defined by conscious decision making.

We also consider how **all** Developers as playing a part in the architecture role and how the modern architect facilitates this.
