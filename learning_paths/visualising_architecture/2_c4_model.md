# C4 Model
The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) focusses on the visual communication and documentation of software architecture. It doesnâ€™t present a formalised, standardised method to communicate software architecture, it does provide a collection of lightweight ideas and techniques that we've observed to be useful.

We've observed the use of the C4 Model with our active deliveries and found that it:
- Provides a lean approach to diagramming a software architecture at multiple levels
- It helps focus on providing clear and concise meaning
- Is useful as starting point for other techniques such as risk storming
- Has a wide range of diagram types that are easy to learn, create and understand
- Isn't mandatory to create versions of all of the diagrams, only use ones that appropriate. System Context and Container diagrams are the most widely used.
- is a simple but not simplistic approach to visualising architecture

The creator of C4 Simon Brown has published a called `Visualising Software Architecture`, which is part of our [recommended reading list](/resources.md)

## Structurizr
We recommend using the [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) in conjunction with the [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl) as a way to automatically generate the C4 diagrams from code. This allows for the Structurizr code to be kept in the same repository as the code of the system, making it easier to keep the two up to date together.

 A [Structurizr quick start template](https://github.com/madetech/structurizr-template) has been created that you can use as a starting point in your own projects.
