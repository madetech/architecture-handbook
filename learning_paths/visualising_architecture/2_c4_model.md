# C4 Model
The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) focuses on the visual communication and documentation of software architecture. It doesnâ€™t present a formalised, standardised method to communicate software architecture, it does however provide a collection of lightweight ideas and techniques that we've observed to be useful.

We've observed the use of the C4 Model with our active deliveries and found that it:
- Provides a lean approach to diagramming a software architecture at multiple levels
- Helps focus on providing clear and concise meaning
- Is useful as starting point for other techniques such as risk storming
- Has a wide range of diagram types that are easy to learn, create and understand
- Isn't mandatory to create versions of all of the diagrams, only use ones that appropriate. System Context and Container diagrams are the most widely used.
- Is a simple but not simplistic approach to visualising architecture

The creator of C4 Simon Brown has published a book called `Visualising Software Architecture`, which is part of our [recommended reading list](/resources.md)
