# Introducing the Principles

## Understanding Context

### Playbook part 1 - 'Holistic Thinking'

## Software Architecture

### Code design principles (SOLID)
### Component principles
### Architecture principles
#### setting Boundaries
#### Separating layers

## Day to day Activities

### Continually visualise the technical architecture

-   Fosters common understanding of architecture to technical and non-technical stakeholders
-   Aligns to evolving architecture through techniques such as minimum viable architecture (MVA)
-   Provides value for enabling techniques such as risk storming
-   Can help with speeding up comprehension of architecture for new team members

-   C4 model provides a lean approach to diagramming a software architecture at multiple levels
-   Focus on providing clear meaning
-   Useful as starting point for other techniques such as risk storming

### Describing the purpose of a component

-   Aligns to single responsibility principle
-   Able to reason easily about the architecture
-   Inability to be able to do this implies complex / multi-responsibility component or other associated 'code smells'

### Keeping documentation close to code
We have observed that proximity of documentation to code leads to increased freshness of documentation     

 - Simplifies checking updates have been done as part of Definition of
   Done
 - Documentation / diagrams as code Change from static
 - diagrams done at the start/end of a delivery to living parts of the  
   delivery that add value in terms of domain context

### Identifying 'non' requirements
###  Managing risk

[Risk Storming](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Friskstorming.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3BVCnFt1o6K9xYXddpDFY9)
    
-   A visual and collaborative risk identification technique
-   Can be applied to architectures, business processes, workflows, etc
-   Can be applied multiple times during the lifetime of the thing being risk stormed

### Communicate into the future

-   Communication is a key architecture skill
-   Consider the context of who you are communicating too and how it would be best received or understood
-   Simple not simplistic
-   You must consider future teams and architects, years from now decisions will be questioned and problems revisited. Shortcut that future pain by making sure the past can be understood.

-   A framework for recording choices that are architecturally significant
-   Helps with knowledge transfer over the lifetime of a product
-   The process of filling in ADRs helps solidify thinking on a decision
