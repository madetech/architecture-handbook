# A word on Microservices vs Monoliths

Microservices are popular as (in theory) they force a number of the above principals onto teams by splitting up services into small domain concerns with clear interfaces. They provide other advantages such as (but not limited to):

-   Scalability improvements
-   Improved fault isolation
-   Program language and technology agnostic
-   Reusability across different areas of business

However they also have a management overhead and if designed poorly can be unintentionally tightly coupled (e.g a distributed monolith) which can become a nightmare to maintain.

We believe a team should understand how to create a loosely coupled Monolith before embarking on Microservices so recommend the video below.
