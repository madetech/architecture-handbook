# The Modern Architect

Within the Public Sector 'Transformation' is everywhere.

Everyone is on some transformation journey, whether just starting out or maturing and improving.

As an architect your role is often to deliver and accelerate this transformation.

The role has been described as 'some kind of digital guru' which can feel a bit overwhelming but it comes down to architects being **'agents of change'**.

The modern architect does not operate in a silo but has a broader role, bringing the organisation together around lean and agile methodologies to enable the most effective technical delivery for a service. They work closely with Delivery Managers and Product Owners managing trade offs and leading technical decision making from a position of informed knowledge.
