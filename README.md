## Principles, Processes, Standards and Tools

We maintain a list of [principles](principles.md) that we have observed teams using to be successful.

We also have a list of [tools](principles/tools.md) that we find useful.

We have an [Interactive Skills Radar](https://madetech.github.io/skills-radar-prototype/) which you can use to gauge your architecture skills.
