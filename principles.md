### The Big List of Principles

## Software Design

##  Designing Components so they are *stable*

Balancing cohesion and coupling

## Set Boundaries between software elements

Boundaries separate things that matter from things that donâ€™t, i.e. high-level components from low-level components

## Separate layers and organise them using the *dependency rule*

Outer layers should depend on inner layers (at the source-level), and not vice versa.

## Behaviours

## Continually visualise the technical architecture

## Keep documentation close to code
We have observed that proximity of documentation to code leads to increased freshness of documentation     

 - Simplifies checking updates have been done as part of Definition of
   Done
 - Documentation / diagrams as code Change from static
 - diagrams done at the start/end of a delivery to living parts of the  
   delivery that add value in terms of domain context

## Communicate into the future

-   Communication is a key architecture skill
-   Consider the context of who you are communicating too and how it would be best received or understood
-   Simple not simplistic
-   You must consider future teams and architects, years from now decisions will be questioned and problems revisited. Shortcut that future pain by making sure the past can be understood.

-   A framework for recording choices that are architecturally significant
-   Helps with knowledge transfer over the lifetime of a product
-   The process of filling in ADRs helps solidify thinking on a decision
