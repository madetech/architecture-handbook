### The Big List of Principles

## Software Design

##  Designing Components so they are *stable*

Balancing cohesion and coupling

## Set Boundaries between software elements

Boundaries separate things that matter from things that donâ€™t, i.e. high-level components from low-level components

## Separate layers and organise them using the *dependency rule*

Outer layers should depend on inner layers (at the source-level), and not vice versa.

## Don't add complexity where it is not needed

For example:
* Most services we build are simple forms
* We should avoid Business Logic in the User Interface. If the project requires it, we **should** include an [Architecture Decision Record](./principles/communicate_into_the_future.md) explaining why
* Avoid using JavaScript in the User Interface in the project. The project **should** include an [Architecture Decision Record](./principles/communicate_into_the_future.md) explaining why. Even if the project uses standard GOV.uk/local authorities' approved components
