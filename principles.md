### The Big List of Principles

## Software Design

##  Designing Components so they are *stable*

Balancing cohesion and coupling

## Set Boundaries between software elements

Boundaries separate things that matter from things that donâ€™t, i.e. high-level components from low-level components

## Separate layers and organise them using the *dependency rule*

Outer layers should depend on inner layers (at the source-level), and not vice versa.

## Behaviours

## Continually visualise the technical architecture
