### Software Architecture Principles we believe are important

 - **Designing Components** so they are *stable* (balancing cohesion and coupling)
 - **Setting Boundaries** between software elements. Boundaries  separate things that matter from things that donâ€™t, i.e. high-level components from low-level components
 - **Separating layers** and organising them using the *dependency rule*: outer layers should depend on inner layers (at the source-level), and not vice versa.
