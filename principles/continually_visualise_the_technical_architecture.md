# Continually visualise the technical architecture

-   Fosters common understanding of architecture to technical and non-technical stakeholders
-   Aligns to evolving architecture through techniques such as minimum viable architecture (MVA)
-   Provides value for enabling techniques such as risk storming
-   Can help with speeding up comprehension of architecture for new team members

See the [visualising architecture](../learning_paths/visualising_architecture.md) learning path for more information.
