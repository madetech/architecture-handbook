# Continually visualise the technical architecture

-   Fosters common understanding of architecture to technical and non-technical stakeholders
-   Aligns to evolving architecture through techniques such as minimum viable architecture (MVA)
-   Provides value for enabling techniques such as risk storming
-   Can help with speeding up comprehension of architecture for new team members

## C4

We recommend the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/)

-   C4 model provides a lean approach to diagramming a software architecture at multiple levels
-   Focus on providing clear meaning
-   Useful as starting point for other techniques such as risk storming
- See the [tools section.](./tools.md)
